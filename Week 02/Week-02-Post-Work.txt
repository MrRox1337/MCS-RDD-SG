Week 01 Submission:

	Review week_1_post_demo1.ino and motors_demonstration_uno1.ino and related files to make the motor
        move forward or backward and keep an object between 30 cm and 50 cm. If the object is beyond 50 cm
        the motor will spin clockwise and if the object is less than 30 cm from the sensor the motors will
        move backwards. 

When you complete the code, please create a public repository with MCS-RDD-SG and upload a folder called Week 02 Post containing
a .png for your circuit and a .ino file for your code.
