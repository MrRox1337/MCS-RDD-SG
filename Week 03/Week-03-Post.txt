Week 03 Submission:

	Visit link #5, GrabCAD.com, and use their resources to create 6 rods, 3 rods are 2020 profile
	aluminum extrusions and the other 3 are 2040 profile aluminum extrusions. For both profiles
	make a 100mm, 150mm, and 200mm length rod on OnShape and export all 6 as STL or 3MF file format.

When you complete the code, please create a public repository with MCS-RDD-SG and upload a folder called Week 03 Post containing
your STL or 3MF models.
