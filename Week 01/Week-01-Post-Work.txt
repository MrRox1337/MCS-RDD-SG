Week 01 Submission:

	Review 3_led_pot_uno1.ino/png and pot_servo_sonic_uno1.ino/png files for code inspiration and create a program that
	utilizes an ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor to cause a servo to set an angle based on the distance of an object from HC-SR04
	between 25cm and 100cm. Additionally, 3 LEDs will indicate the proximity of the object such that all three LEDs will be on
	when the object is under 25cm, and no LEDs are on when the object is beyond 100cm.

When you complete the code, please create a public repository with MCS-RDD-SG and upload a folder called Week 01 Post containing
a .png for your circuit and a .ino file containing your code.
